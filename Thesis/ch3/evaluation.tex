The ROMC implementation provides two functions for evaluating the inference results,

\begin{itemize}
\item \mintinline{python}{romc.compute_divergence(gt_posterior, step=0.1, distance="Jensen-Shannon")}
\item \mintinline{python}{romc.compute_ess()}
\end{itemize}

The \mintinline{python}{romc.compute_divergence(gt_posterior, step=0.1, distance="Jensen-Shannon")} 

\subsubsection*{Function (i): \mintinline{python}{romc.compute_divergence(theta)}}

This function computes the divergence between the ROMC approximation
and the ground truth posterior. Since the compuation of the divergence
is performed using the Riemann approximation in can only work in low
dimensional parametric spaces; it is suggested to be used for up to a
$3D$ parametric space.As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter,
in a real-case scenario it is not expected the ground-truth posterior
to be available; this is the whole meaning of performing the
inference. However, there are two scenarios where this functionality
can be useful; (a) when the likelihood is tractable and we want to
check the accuracy of the ROMC method (as in the running-example) (b)
when we want to compute the divergence between the ROMC's posterior
approximation and another approximation e.g.\ ABC Rejection. The
argument \pinline{step} defines step used in the Riemann approximation
and the argument \pinline{distance} can take either the
\pinline{Jensen-Shannon} or the \pinline{KL-divergence} value, for
computing the appropriate distance.

\subsubsection*{Function (ii): \mintinline{python}{romc.compute_ess()}}

This function compute the Effective Sample Size (ESS) using the following expression,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ESS}
  ESS = \frac{(\sum_i w_i)^2}{\sum_i w_i^2}
\end{equation}


\begin{pythoncode}
res = romc.compute_divergence(wrapper, distance="Jensen-Shannon")                                 
print("Jensen-Shannon divergence: %.3f" % res)
# Jensen-Shannon divergence: 0.025

print("Nof Samples: %d, ESS: %.3f" % (len(romc.result.weights), romc.compute_ess()))
# Nof Samples: 19950, ESS: 16694.816
\end{pythoncode}
