The remainder of the dissertation is organized as follows. In Chapter
2 we establish the mathematical formulation; more specifically we
initially describe the Simulator-Based models and we provide some
fundamental algorithms that have been proposed for performing
statistical inference. Afterwards, we provide the mathematical
description of the ROMC approach \autocite{Ikonomov2019}. In Chapter 3, we
deal with the implementation part; we initially provide some
information regarding the Python package Engine for Likelihood-Free
Inference (ELFI) \autocite{1708.00707} and subsequently we present the
implementation details of ROMC in this package. In Chapter 4, we
illustrate the functionalities of the ROMC implementation at some
real-world examples; this chapter wishes to demonstrate the success of
the ROMC method and of our implementation at Likelihood-Free
tasks. Finally, in Chapter 5, we conclude with some thoughts on the
work we have done and some future research ideas.
