Since the dissertation is mainly focused on the implementation of the
ROMC, we have created some jupyter notebooks for supporting the main
document. Incorporating the notebooks the reader is able to (a) view
the code used for performing the inference as a whole (b) understand
the functionalities of our implementation in a practical sense (c)
check the validity of our claims and (c) interactively execute
experiments.

The notebooks are provided in two different formats:\footnote{The
  notebooks in the two repositories are identical.}

\begin{itemize}
\item The first format is located In
  \href{https://github.com/givasile/edinburgh-thesis/tree/master/notebook_examples}{this}
  Github repository. In order for the reader to experiment with the
  examples, they should \textit{clone} the repository locally, execute
  the installation instructions and run the notebooks using the
  \textit{Jupyter} package.
\item The second format is the google colab notebook. Following the
  link, the reader can view the notebook and make an online clone of
  it. Hence, without any installation overhead, they may
  interactivelly explore all the provided functionalities.
\end{itemize}


Throughout the document, we may refer to the notebooks whenever we
want to let the reader observe a specific functionality. The notebooks
provide a practical overview of the implemented functionalities and it
are easy to use; in particular, the google colab version is entirely
plug-and-play. Therefore, we encourage the reader of the dissertation
to use them as supporting material.  The following list contains the
implemented examples along with their links:

\begin{itemize}
